This project demonstrates the use of various DDL (Data Definition Language) constraints and SQL operations to manage a simple database for a sales system.

* Create a database named Sales

* Create a table named Orders with columns: Order_Id (Primary Key, Unique, Not Null) , Customer_name (Not Null) , Product_Category , Ordered_item (Not Null) , Contact_No` (Unique, Not Null)

Perform a series of operations including adding new columns, renaming tables, inserting data, updating data, retrieving data, and deleting tables.

## Tasks

1. Create the Database and Table : To start, we create a database named Sales, then define a table Orders with the specified constraints.

2. Add a New Column : Add a new column order_quantity to the Orders table.

3. Rename the Table : Rename the Orders table to sales_orders.

4. Insert Data : Insert 10 rows of data into the sales_orders table.

5. Retrieve Data : Retrieve the Customer_name and Ordered_item from the sales_orders table.
